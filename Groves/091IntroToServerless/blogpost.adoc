== Intro

serverless is a buzz word

is doesn't mean there aren't servers, it just means that the server is abstracted away

in some cases it can free your enterprise from the costs of maintaining infrastructure, upgrades, provisioning servers

== What is Serverless?

you write code

the servers that execute that code are automatically provisioned by a cloud provider

code is triggered by events (could be as simple as an HTTP request, or it could be some other event - link to azure function events)

== Serverless vs Microservice

There is some similarity between breaking up an application into microservices and using serverless in your application

microservice, you might have a "shopping cart" service

- this service has c r u d operations in it
- it operates with a database
- the microservice is will use, say, a VM even while idle, and you'll be charged for VM time

for serverless, you might have 4 "functions" to handle each c r u d operations

- you deploy 4 functions instead of 1 service
- each function operates with a database
- you don't have to provision a VM
- the function only consumes resources when needed, and you are only charged for that


== Benefits of Serverless

scalability is handled by the infrastructure to handle demand

costs are tied to usage

reduced admin costs / improved agile iteration - reduced need for IT operations, at least initially, because there are no servers to deploy, fewer servers to manage/upgrade/etc, possible improved developer productivity

== Couchbase and Serverless

there are several popular serverless providers:

microsoft azure functions
amazon lambdas
google cloud whatever
and many more

Couchbase Server can run on any of these clouds, or on multiple cloud vendors, or on a cloud hybrid. This makes it a great choice when you need a NoSQL document database to use with serverless computing

*no vendor lock in*, you aren't even locked into the cloud. with XDCR, you can  go cloud-first, and have an on-premise cluster for DR, or deploy couchbase to multiple clouds

*cloud marketplace offerings* get started in minutes on azure, aws, gcp - link to azure video

*sdks for your language* couchbase offers SDKs for node, .net, java, and other languages - link to azure functions blog posts, no matter your serverless platform or language preferences, couchbase has you covered

*scaling* with couchbase is easy and efficient, shared nothing architecture, each node does reads and writes (masterless), high availability

*flexibility of json* almost every app can benefit from a flexible schema, even if you're using a relational database for your system of record, couchbase can be the system of engagement

== Summary

serverless takes decomposition of apps one step further

storing json data in Couchbase gives you schema flexibility and scaling flexibility
