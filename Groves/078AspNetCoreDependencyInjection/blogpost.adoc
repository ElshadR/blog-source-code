Dependency Injection is a design pattern that makes coding easier. It saves you the hassle of instantiating objects with complex dependencies, and it makes it easier for you to write tests. With the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/blob/master/docs/dependency-injection.md[Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection library (GitHub)], you can easily use Couchbase clusters and buckets within the ASP.NET Core dependency injection framework.

In my last blog post on link:https://blog.couchbase.com/distributed-caching-aspnet-couchbase/[distributed caching with ASP.NET], I mentioned the DependencyInjection library briefly. Dependency injection will be explored in-depth in this post. Feel free to follow along with the code samples I've created, available on link://[GitHub].

== Basic setup of Couchbase

First, you'll need a Couchbase Server cluster running (you can install it link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/install/install-intro.html[on-premise], or link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/getting-started/do-a-quick-install.html[with Docker], or even link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise[in Azure] if you'd like).

Next, you'll need to link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[create a bucket] in Couchbase. This can be the "travel-sample" bucket that comes with Couchbase, or a bucket that you create yourself.

If you are using Couchbase Server 5.0, you'll also need to create a user with permissions on that bucket. Give that user Cluster Admin permission, and give it the same name as the bucket, just to keep things simple.

== Dependency Injection with Couchbase.Extensions

The link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions[Couchbase.Extensions (GitHub)] project aims to make working with Couchbase Server and .NET Core simpler. Dependency Injection is just one of these extensions.

You can add it to your ASP.NET Core project with NuGet, via Package Manager: `Install-Package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection -Version 1.0.2`, or with the NuGet UI, or you can use the .NET command line: `dotnet add package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection --version 1.0.2`.

Once you've added this to your project, you'll need to make changes to your `Startup` class in `Startup.cs`.

In the blog post on caching, I simply hard-coded the configuration:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=noconfig]
----

This is fine for demos and blog posts, but in reality, you probably want to use a configuration file. This way, you don't necessarily have to recompile every time you make a configuration change.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=config]
----

Assuming you're using the default `appsettings.json`, update that file to change configuration information:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/appsettings.json[lines=8..13]
----

By specifying the "Couchbase" section, the dependency injection module will read configuration right from the appsettings.json text file.

== Constructor Injection

Now that dependency injection is setup, you can start injecting useful objects into your classes. You might inject them into an MVC/WebAPI Controller class, a repository class, or a service class.

Here's an example of injecting into `HomeController`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=inject]

        // ... snip ...
    }
----

Next, let's do a simple `Get` operation on a well-known document in "travel-sample" just to show that this is working. I'll make a change to the generate `About` action method, and write out the equipment number of the Columbus to Chicago flight for United (a route that I fly often):

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=About]
----

And the result is:

image:07802-travel-sample-result.png[Travel sample output of a single route]

_If you aren't using "travel-sample", use a key from your own bucket instead of "route_56027"._

== Named buckets

You can use the dependency injection module to inject a specific bucket instead of having to specify the bucket name each time.

Start by creating an empty interface that implements `INamedBucketProvider`. Leave it empty. Here's an example:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Models/ITravelSampleBucketProvider.cs[tag=ITravelSampleBucketProvider]
----

Then, back in Startup.cs, map this interface to a bucket using `AddCouchbaseBucket`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=namedbucket]
----

Now, the `ITravelSampleBucketProvider` can be injected instead.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=bucketinject]
----

== More complex dependency injection

Until now, only Controllers have been used with dependency injection. In a real project, dependency injection really starts to be valuable when you have a more complex object graph.

As an example, here's a service class that uses Couchbase, but also uses an email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Models/ComplexService.cs[tag=ComplexService]
----

This service itself is used by a controller. But notice that the controller is not directly using either the bucket or the email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/ApproveController.cs[tag=ApproveController]
----

If I were to instantiate `ComplexService` manually, I would have to instantiate at least three objects: `new ComplexService(new BucketProvider(), new MyEmailService()`. That's a lot that I have to keep track of, and if any dependencies change, it's potentially a lot of manual maintenance.

Instead, I can just tell ASP.NET Core how to use dependency injection to do all this for me:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=moredi]
----

Now, ASP.NET Core knows how to instantiate:
* `ITravelSampleBucketProvider`, thanks to Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection
* `IEmailService` - I told it to use `MyEmailService`
* `IComplexService` - I told it to use `ComplexService`
* `ApproveController` - ASP.NET Core knows how to instantiate controllers

So finally, when executing an action in `ApproveController`, it will know how to create and inject `ComplexService` automatically. The end result:

== Cleaning up

Don't forget to clean up after yourself. If the ASP.NET Core application is stopped, you can gracefully release any resources that the Couchbase .NET SDK is using. In the `Configure` method in Startup, add a parameter of type `IApplicationLifetime`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=Configure]
----

Within that `Configure` method, setup an `ApplicationStopped` event:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=cleanup]
----

== Summary

Dependency injection is a rich subject. Entire books have been written about it and its benefits to your application. This blog post just scratched the surface and didn't even cover the testability benefits.

`Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection` makes it easier for you to use dependency injection and Couchbase configuration together with ASP.NET Core.
