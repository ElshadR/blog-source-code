Dependency Injection is a design pattern that makes coding easier. It saves you the hassle of instantiating objects with complex dependencies, and it makes it easier for you to write tests. With the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/blob/master/docs/dependency-injection.md[Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection library (GitHub)], you can use Couchbase clusters and buckets within the ASP.NET Core dependency injection framework.

In my last blog post on link:https://blog.couchbase.com/distributed-caching-aspnet-couchbase/[distributed caching with ASP.NET], I mentioned the DependencyInjection library. Dependency injection will be explored in-depth in this post. Feel free to follow along with the code samples I've created, available on link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/blog-source-code/tree/master/Groves/078AspNetCoreDependencyInjection/src/CouchbaseDIExample[GitHub].

== Basic setup of Couchbase

First, you'll need a Couchbase Server cluster running. You can:

* Install it link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/install/install-intro.html[on-premise]
* Run in a container link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/getting-started/do-a-quick-install.html[with Docker]
* Use a cloud service like link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise[Azure]

Next, you'll need to link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/clustersetup/create-bucket.html[create a bucket] in Couchbase. This can be the "travel-sample" bucket that comes with Couchbase, or a bucket that you create yourself.

_If you are using Couchbase Server 5.0, you'll also need to create a user. Give that user Cluster Admin permission, and give it the same name as the bucket, just to keep things simple if you are following along._

== Dependency Injection with Couchbase.Extensions

The link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions[Couchbase.Extensions (GitHub)] project aims to make working with Couchbase Server and ASP.NET Core simpler. Dependency Injection is just one of these extensions.

You can add it to your ASP.NET Core project with NuGet:

* By using Package Manager: `Install-Package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection -Version 1.0.2`
* With the NuGet UI
* Use the .NET command line: `dotnet add package Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection --version 1.0.2`

_(Version 1.0.2 is the latest version at the time of writing)._

Next, you'll need to make changes to your `Startup` class in `Startup.cs`.

In the blog post on caching, I hard-coded the configuration:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=noconfig]
----

This is fine for demos and blog posts, but you'll likely want to use a configuration file for a production project.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=config]
----

Assuming you're using the default `appsettings.json`, update that file to add a Couchbase section:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/appsettings.json[lines=8..13]
----

By making a "Couchbase" section, the dependency injection module will read right from the appsettings.json text file.

== Constructor Injection

After dependency injection is setup, you can start injecting useful objects into your classes. You might inject them into Controllers, services, or repositories.

Here's an example of injecting into `HomeController`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=inject]

        // ... snip ...
    }
----

Next, let's do a simple `Get` operation on a well-known document in "travel-sample". This token usage of the Couchbase .NET SDK will show dependency injection in action. I'll make a change to the generated `About` action method. In that method, it will retrieve a route document and write out the equipment number.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=About]
----

And the result is:

image:07802-travel-sample-result.png[Travel sample output of a single route]

Success! Dependency injection worked, and we're ready to use a Couchbase bucket.

_If you aren't using "travel-sample", use a key from your own bucket._

== Named buckets

You can use dependency injection for a single bucket instead of having to specify the name each time.

Start by creating an interface that implements `INamedBucketProvider`. Leave it empty. Here's an example:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Models/ITravelSampleBucketProvider.cs[tag=ITravelSampleBucketProvider]
----

Then, back in Startup.cs, map this interface to a bucket using `AddCouchbaseBucket`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=namedbucket]
----

Now, the `ITravelSampleBucketProvider` gets injected instead of the more general provider.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/HomeController.cs[tag=bucketinject]
----

== More complex dependency injection

Until this point, we've only used dependency injection on Controllers. Dependency injection starts to pay dividends with more complex, deeper object graphs.

As an example, imagine a service class that uses a Couchbase bucket, but also uses an email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Models/ComplexService.cs[tag=ComplexService]
----

Next, let's use this service in a controller (aka making it a dependency). But notice that the controller is not directly using either the bucket or the email service.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Controllers/ApproveController.cs[tag=ApproveController]
----

If I were to instantiate `ComplexService` manually, I would have to instantiate at least two other objects. It would look something like: `new ComplexService(new BucketProvider(), new MyEmailService()`. That's a lot that I have to keep track of, and if any dependencies change, it's a lot of manual maintenance.

Instead, I can have ASP.NET Core use dependency injection to do all this for me. Back in `Startup`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=moredi]
----

Now, ASP.NET Core knows how to instantiate:

* `ITravelSampleBucketProvider`, thanks to Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection
* `IEmailService` - I told it to use `MyEmailService`
* `IComplexService` - I told it to use `ComplexService`

Finally, when `ApproveController` is instantiated, ASP.NET Core will know how to do it. It will create `ComplexService` by instantiating `MyEmailService` and `ComplexService`. It will inject `ComplexService` automatically into `ApproveController`'s constructor. The end result:

== Cleaning up

Don't forget to clean up after yourself. When the ASP.NET Core application is stops, release any resources that the Couchbase .NET SDK is using. In the `Configure` method in Startup, add a parameter of type `IApplicationLifetime`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=Configure]
----

Within that `Configure` method, setup an `ApplicationStopped` event:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseDIExample/CouchbaseDIExample/Startup.cs[tag=cleanup]
----

== Summary

Dependency injection is a rich subject. Entire books have been written about it and its benefits to your application. This blog post just scratched the surface and didn't even cover the testability benefits.

Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection makes it easier to inject Couchbase into ASP.NET Core.
