ASP.NET is the development platform that most Microsoft developers use. At the link:https://resources.couchbase.com/cc17_watch_ondemand[Couchbase Connect Silicon Valley 2017 conference], I spoke to some .NET developers in a workshop. I asked them what type of content they'd like to see me create that would be most useful for them. The answer was: videos on getting started.

== ASP.NET Tools to Get Started

The below video takes you from having no code to having an HTTP-based REST API that uses Couchbase Server, built with ASP.NET.

The video uses the following tools:

* link:https://www.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio 2017]
* link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0 Community Edition] (Enterprise Edition will also work just fine)
* link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/dotnet/start-using-sdk.html[Couchbase .NET SDK]
* ASP.NET (not ASP.NET Core, that's coming in a later video)
* link:https://swagger.io/[Swagger] (provided by link:https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle[Swashbuckle])

In the video, I briefly gloss over Scan Consistency. For more details on that, check out the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/indexes/performance-consistency.html[Scan Consistency documentation] or read link:https://blog.couchbase.com/new-to-couchbase-4-5-atplus/[a blog post that I wrote introducing AtPlus, which also covers the other types of Scan Consistency].

== Summary

This video gives you the absolute minimum to get started with Couchbase by walking you through a simple CRUD application. Stay tuned for a similar video on getting started with ASP.NET Core.
