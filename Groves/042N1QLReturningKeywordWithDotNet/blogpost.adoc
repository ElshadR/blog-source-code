= Using the N1QL RETURNING keyword from .NET Core

I've recently learned about the RETURNING keyword in link:http://www.couchbase.com/n1ql?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[N1QL]. When you add it to end of a N1QL query, that query will return the result set that was operated on. For instance, if you use an UPDATE, and that query updates 10 documents, the RETURNING will then return those 10 documents.

You can use this within your .NET and .NET Core link:http://developer.couchbase.com?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[Couchbase] applications.

== Basic Setup

This blog post assumes that you have Couchbase Server setup locally, a bucket created called "default", and at least a primary index created on that bucket.

_Note: if you are having trouble getting started with Couchbase Server, or you are getting errors, especially in regards to N1QL indexing, you may want to revisit some of my "Getting Started" blog posts:_ link:http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/may/couchbase-with-windows-and-.net---part-1[Couchbase with Windows Part 1] _and_ link:http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/may/couchbase-with-windows-and-.net---part-2[Couchbase with Windows Part 2] _in particular_.

I'm created a simple .NET Core console project, with the same tooling and setup that I used in my link:http://blog.couchbase.com/2016/november/.net-core-with-visual-studio-code[.NET Core with Visual Studio Code blog post].

== Coding with .NET and N1QL

Most of this code should be pretty familiar if you used .NET and Couchbase before. I'm creating 5 documents that have (initially) a processed field set to `false`. This code inserts them. It also writes them out to console for illustration purposes.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/Program.cs[tag=createdocuments]
----

Next, this code immediately runs a N1QL `UPDATE` to set all the `processed` fields to true. It also has a `RETURNING` statement at the end to return the document as well as the key.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/Program.cs[tag=updatereturning]
----

Finally, I would expect the 5 documents I created to be returned by the RETURNING (along with their keys). This code prints out the returned JSON to console for illustration purposes.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/Program.cs[tag=showreturning]
----

== Running the program

To execute this program, simple enter `dotnet run` at the console window. You should see an output like this:

== Summary

The `RETURNING` keyword can save you a step when updating/inserting a group of documents. Try experimenting with a more complex `UPDATE` to see what happens. For example, try using `IS MISSING` instead of relying on a boolean flag like 'processed'.
