Authentication and authorization are vastly improved in Couchbase Server 5.0. We've been blogging about the new RBAC features in the developer preview for a while.

Now that Couchbase Server 5.0 is released, I'm writing a more in-depth blog post about how to use the Couchbase .NET SDK along with these new features.

== Authentication using the .NET SDK

As I mentioned in the previous posts, the days of buckets with passwords are gone. The future belongs to users--users that have specific permission(s) to specific bucket(s).

Then, before we can do anything, we need to create a user. You might want to create a user with the UI, but you can also create a user with the SDK.
