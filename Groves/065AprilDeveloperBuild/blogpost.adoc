April showers bring May Flowers, but until then it's time for the April 2017 developer build.

The April 2017 Developer Build has a ton of bug fixes and feature enhancements, and we are one step closer to the stable release of Couchbase 5.0.

You can get the April 2017 developer build from the link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase downloads page] in the developer tab.

== New platforms in April 2017 Developer Build

Based on the feedback we have received, here are some additional platforms that we would like introduce starting with the April Developer Build. We hope you try out the April Developer Build on these platforms and give us your feedback!

* Oracle Linux 7 
* Ubuntu Ubuntu 16.04
* Windows Server 2016 

_Note that Ubuntu 12 is EOL this month, so future Couchbase releases will likely not support Ubuntu 12._

== Bugs 

Here is a list of the critical and major bugs that were fixed in the April 2017 Developer Build.

Thank you for you feedback and helping us to identify and fix bugs for Couchbase Server 5.0. We're still looking for your help.
