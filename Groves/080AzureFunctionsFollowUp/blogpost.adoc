Azure Functions are still new to me, and I'm learning as I'm going. I blogged about my foray into Azure Functions with Couchbase link:https://blog.couchbase.com/azure-functions-couchbase-server/[over a month ago]. Right after I posted that, I got some helpful feedback about the way I was instantiating a Couchbase cluster (and bucket).

I had (wrongly) assumed that there was no way to save state between Azure Function calls. This is why I created a `GetCluster()` method that was called each time the function ran. But, initializing a Couchbase `Cluster` object is an expensive operation. The less often you instantiate it, the better.

_You can follow along with the updated link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/blog-source-code/tree/master/Groves/080AzureFunctionsFollowUp/src/CouchbaseWithAzureFunctions[source code for this blog post on Github]._

== Static state

I had a hard time finding documentation on whether I could use a `static` object for reuse between function calls. I suppose I should have experimented, like link:http://markheath.net/post/sharing-state-between-azure-functions[fellow Microsoft MVP Mark Heath] did. Instead, I link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46162151/azure-functions-singleton-for-expensive-object[posed the question to StackOverflow].

In short: yes. A `Cluster`, instantiated and saved to a static member, can is reusable between function calls. According to Mark's post above, there's no guarantee how long this value will survive. But that's an expected trade-off that you make when going "serverless".

== Lazy initializing within Azure Functions

Simply using a static member would work, but it's not thread-safe. There are a few ways to tackle that issue, but an easy way that's built right into the .NET framework is to use link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/performance/lazy-initialization[Lazy Initialization] with `Lazy<T>`.

First, I removed the `GetBucket` and `GetCluster` methods. Next, I created a `Lazy<IBucket>` property to replace them.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseWithAzureFunctions/CouchbaseWithAzureFunctions/WriteToCouchbase.cs[tag=lazy]
----

I just made a single property for a bucket, since that's all I need for this example. But if you need to use the cluster, you can easily make that its own `Lazy` property. (Once you have a cluster, getting a bucket is a relatively cheap operation).

== Using a Lazy property

When you instantiate a `Lazy<T>` object, you supply it with an initialization lambda. That lambda won't execute until the `Value` property is actually called for the first time.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
var lazyObject = new Lazy<string>(() =>
{
    // this code won't be called until 'lazyObject.Value' is referenced
    // for the first time
    return "I'm lazy!";
});
----

For instance, notice the `Value` between `Bucket` and `GetAsync` in the updated version of my Azure Functions:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/CouchbaseWithAzureFunctions/CouchbaseWithAzureFunctions/WriteToCouchbase.cs[tag=bucket]
----

If that's the first time `Value` is used, the cluster will be initialized. Otherwise, it will use the already initialized cluster (try experimenting with a `Guid` instead of a `Bucket`).

== Summary

State can be saved between Azure Function calls by using a static member. Make sure that it's thread-safe (by using `Lazy<T>` or something like it). Don't make any assumptions about how long that object will be around.
