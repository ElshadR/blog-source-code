Test Drive is an Azure feature that allows you to try out software in the cloud for free.

Previously, I wrote about how link:https://blog.couchbase.com/azure-getting-started-easy-free/[Getting started with Couchbase on Azure is easy and free]. That post told you how to get started with $200 in Azure credit. With Test Drive, however, it's even easier to get started, and you don't have to use any of that $200 credit.

== Test Drive on Azure Marketplace

The only thing you need before you start is a Microsoft account, which is free.

Start by going to the link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise?tab=Overview[Couchbase Enterprise product page on Azure].

There's a big "Test Drive" button. Simply click to get started.

Before you click to get started, notice that the Test Drive has a limited duration. You will get 3 hours to evaluate Couchbase Server.

== Step by Step Evaluation Labs

We've prepared link:https://github.com/couchbase-partners/test-drive[4 step-by-step labs] that you can follow to start evaluating Couchbase Server.

The test drive deployment is a fully functional Couchbase Server Enterprise cluster with all features enabled. The only limit you have is time.

== Summary

Couchbase is proud to partner with Microsoft to make this test drive available to you.
