Fast failover is one of the many improvements that come with the release of link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0] (now available for download).

Failover is one of the important concepts to understand when it comes to distributed databases. link:https://www.infoq.com/articles/cap-twelve-years-later-how-the-rules-have-changed[The CAP theorem] states that a distributed database can't be both available and consistent all of the time. Couchbase Server's architecture is designed to be always consistent, and highly available. With fast failover, that availability has improved even more.

In this blog post, I'm going to demonstrate failover in action. I'll be using Docker to create a cluster of 3 Couchbase nodes on my local machine.

_You can follow along with the code sample in this blog post: it is link://[available on GitHub]._

== Fast failover overview

You'll need a bit of setup and preparation.

First, create a 3-node (at least) Couchbase Server cluster. There are a number of ways to do this, including link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/vagrants[Vagrants], Virtual Machines, actual machines, link:https://blog.couchbase.com/azure-getting-started-easy-free/[Azure], and more. Having at least three nodes will make it possibly to demonstrate fast failover.

I chose to use Docker. I blogged about how to link:https://blog.couchbase.com/docker-and-asp-net-core-with-couchbase-server/[create a Couchbase Cluster on Docker and access it with a .NET Core application](don't forget the bridge network!). So, I just followed those same instructions again. The only difference is that I used a console application instead of an ASP.NET application (which you can read more about later in this post).

I used the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/couchbase/server/tags/[Couchbase Server 5.0.0-beta2 image from Docker Hub], but by the time you read this, an official release of Couchbase Server 5.0 should be link:https://hub.docker.com/r/library/couchbase/tags/[available on the official docker Couchbase repository].

Next, I created a bucket called "mybucket". Make sure to enable replication of 2.

After that, create a user (I called mine "myuser" with at least Data Writer and Data Reader permission for "mybucket"). _If you aren't familiar yet with the Couchbase Server Role-based Access Control (RBAC), start with link:https://blog.couchbase.com/authentication-authorization-rbac-net/[this blog post on Authentication with RBAC and .NET.]_

Finally, turn on automatic fast failover. From the Couchbase Console, go to Settings, and then Auto-Failover. Check the box to "Enable auto-failover". As of version 5.0, you can set the Timeout value to as low as 5 (seconds). Previously, the value had to be at least 30 seconds.

_There is a reason that auto-failover is off by default. Please review the full link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/clustersetup/automatic-failover.html[documentation on automatic failover] to make sure that it's a right fit for you._

== .NET Example

Now that you have a 3-node cluster running inside of your Docker host, it's time to write a demonstration application. I decided to write a console application that would continuously perform reads against Couchbase. At some point, I will "pull the plug" on one of the nodes to show automatic fast failover in action.

=== Connecting to the cluster

After creating a new .NET Core console application, I added the link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/CouchbaseNetClient/[Couchbase .NET SDK (currently version 2.5.1) using NuGet].

Then, I created a configuration to connect to the 3-node cluster, authenticate to "myuser", and open up "mybucket".

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/FastFailoverDemo/FastFailoverDemo/Program.cs[tag=cluster]
----

Those IP addresses are the addresses that are _internal_ to the Docker host. This .NET Core application will also be running inside the Docker host, where those IP addresses will resolve. From _outside_ the docker host, only "localhost:8091" will resolve (assuming you are following the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/docker-and-asp-net-core-with-couchbase-server/[tutorial] I linked to earlier). If you are not using Docker, put in the IP addresses of the Azure machines, the VMs, etc, instead.

Next, the PasswordAuthentication is used to ensure bucket access.

Finally, get a bucket object using `OpenBucket`.

=== Setting up documents

For this demonstration, I want to setup a bunch of documents that I will later be reading from, repeatedly. First, I wrote a loop to create some arbitrary number of documents, that each have a key like "documentKey[num]" (e.g. "documentKey1", "documentKey2", etc).

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/FastFailoverDemo/FastFailoverDemo/Program.cs[tag=createdocs]
----

Next, in my code, `numDocuments` is set to 50. But if you are following along, feel free to set it to another number and see what happens.

=== Reading documents

Therefore, there are 50 documents with well-known keys, the rest of the program will be continuously looping. Each loop iteration will attempt to retreive all 50 documents.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/FastFailoverDemo/FastFailoverDemo/Program.cs[tag=mainloop]
----

First, notice that there's a loop within the loop. The inner loop will run 50 times to perform a `Get` on each document. `ShowResult` will then output what's going on to the console (`ShowResultTerse` does the same thing, just in a much more compact fashion. `ShowResult` is below, but later screenshots will be using `ShowResultTerse`).

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/FastFailoverDemo/FastFailoverDemo/Program.cs[tag=ShowResult]
----

The comments will help you follow along, but `ShowResult` does three checks:

1. Was the read successful? If so, output that. Done! Otherwise...
2. Try to get a replica (from another node). Was THAT successful? If so, output that. Done! Otherwise...
3. The application was unable to read the document or one of its replicas. In this example, that's going to be very rare. In reality, it could mean that the document doesn't exist, or replication isn't configured correctly, or something else has gone wrong.

So, you're ready to run the application. If you're using Docker, don't forget to run this application in Docker (which is link:https://blog.couchbase.com/docker-and-asp-net-core-with-couchbase-server/[easy to do from Visual Studio]). _(Also make sure to connect the .NET Core application container to the Docker bridge network)._

=== Pull the plug!

Before pulling the plug on one of the nodes, let's take a look at what the "normal" output is when running the above .NET Core application.

In the below GIF, you'll see:

* A three node Couchbase Server cluster
* Switch over to Visual Studio
* Build and start the Docker container with CTRL+F5
* The (terse) console output of the Docker container

image:08405-docker-output.gif[Console output from Docker]

(I've sped up the animation a bit). Notice that "S" is being shown 50 times. This means that each document was (s)uccessfully retrieved.

Next, let's show fast failover in action. I'm going to "pull the plug" on one of the nodes. With Docker, I can execute `docker stop db2`, for example.

There is a lot to keep track of at one time, so I've created a short video that demonstrates what's going on.

<iframe width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KbU5eG2R9XU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
+++

What you're seeing in that video is:
1. Normal operation (all "S" for success)
2. A node being stopped (with Docker)
3. Couchbase detecting a node being down.
4. Couchbase initiating fast failover to activate replicas.
5. During that failover period, it's no longer all "S". There are some "R" for replicas (which are read only) in there too.

== Summary

Couchbase Server 5.0 has improved failover with a "fast failover" option that can be useful for environments with solid networking in place.

This blog post shows off a console app that's meant to demonstrate fast failover. It's not a very useful app outside of that, but you can take the principles and apply them to an ASP.NET or ASP.NET Core website.

Check out Couchbase Server 5.0 today for this, and other great new features.
