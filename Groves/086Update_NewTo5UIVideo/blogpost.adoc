Couchbase Console has a refreshed UI in Couchbase Server 5.0. link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0 is now available for download]. But back in January, we were releasing link:https://blog.couchbase.com/2017/january/introducing-developer-builds[developer builds] to get early feedback.

_Note: this blog post is an updated repost of link:https://blog.couchbase.com/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console-video/[A tour of the new Couchbase Web Console (video)]_

Below is the video I recorded of one of the previews to introduce the new UI. I also did a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console/[non-video tour of the new UI].

This video can still give you a basic idea of how the new UI works, and it's also interesting to compare to the 5.0 release to see how your feedback impacted it.

There are a few differences between that video and the actual Couchbase release:

* The nav has been organized a little differently and the "cluster" and "data" nav headings have been removed.
* The overall design is slightly different. There are percentages instead of percent gauges, for instance.
* Some buttons/filters are in different locations. Make sure to check out the top right of each screen for possible actions.
* In the video I mention that security features are coming soon. They are here! Definitely check out the new link:https://blog.couchbase.com/authentication-authorization-rbac-net/[RBAC features].
* You can no longer switch back to the "classic" UI
* The UI feedback feature is no longer available
