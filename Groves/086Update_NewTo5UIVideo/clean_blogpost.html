<p>Couchbase Console has a refreshed UI in Couchbase Server 5.0. <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/downloads">Couchbase Server 5.0 is now available for download</a>. But back in January, we were releasing <a href="https://blog.couchbase.com/2017/january/introducing-developer-builds">developer builds</a> to get early feedback.</p>

<p><em>Note: this blog post is an updated repost of <a href="https://blog.couchbase.com/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console-video/">A tour of the new Couchbase Web Console (video)</a></em></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is the video I recorded of one of the previews to introduce the new UI. I also did a <a href="https://blog.couchbase.com/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console/">non-video tour of the new UI</a>.</p>

<p>This video can still give you a basic idea of how the new UI works, and it&#8217;s also interesting to compare to the 5.0 release to see how your feedback impacted it.</p>

<p>There are a few differences between that video and the actual Couchbase release:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The nav has been organized a little differently and the "cluster" and "data" nav headings have been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The overall design is slightly different. There are percentages instead of percent gauges, for instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some buttons/filters are in different locations. Make sure to check out the top right of each screen for possible actions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the video I mention that security features are coming soon. They are here! Definitely check out the new <a href="https://blog.couchbase.com/authentication-authorization-rbac-net/">RBAC features</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can no longer switch back to the "classic" UI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UI feedback feature is no longer available</p>
</li>
</ul>
