= Austin User Group Visits - October 2016 (Videos)

I spent nearly a week in Texas, visiting four user groups and talking about link:http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/introduction/intro.html?utm_source=blogs&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=blogs[Couchbase] as much as possible.

The first two days of the week I spent in Austin. Here are the videos:

== Austin .NET User Group - Full Stack with .NET

I started the week off with the link:http://adnug.org/Home/october-10-2016-full-stack-development-with-net-and-nosql/[.NET user group in Austin]. Shawn Weisfeld from link:http://usergroup.tv/videos/full-stack-development-with-net-and-nosql[UserGroup.TV] was there to record my session. He has a way better technical setup than what I travel with, so I'm embedding his recording below.
