= New Profiling and Monitoring for Couchbase Server

February's developer preview release of Couchbase Server 5.0.0 is chock full of goodness. In this blog post, I'm going to show you the N1QL query monitoring and profiling tools and some of the new features in this latest developer preview release.

Go link:https://couchbase.com/downloads[download the February 5.0.0 developer release of Couchbase Server] today and check it out. You still have time to give us some feedback before the official release.

_As always, keep in mind that I'm writing this blog post on early builds, and some things may change in minor ways by the time you get the release._

== What is profiling and monitoring for?

When I'm writing N1QL queries, I need to be able to understand how well (or how badly) my query is performing in order to make improvements and diagnose issues.

With this latest developer version of Couchbase Server 5.0, some new tools have been added to your N1QL-writing toolbox.

First, some review. 

There are multiple ways for a developer to execute N1QL queries.

* Use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/sdk/dotnet/n1ql-queries-with-sdk.html[SDK of your choice].
* Use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/cli/cbq-tool.html[cbq command line tool].
* Use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/tools/query-workbench.html[Query Workbench] in Couchbase Web Console
* Use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-rest-api/index.html[REST API N1QL endpoints]

In this post, I'll be mainly using Query Workbench.

There are two link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/tools/query-monitoring.html[system catalogs] that are already available to you in Couchbase Server 4.5 that I'll be talking about today.

* *system:active_request* - This catalog lists all the currently executing active requests or queries. You can execute the N1QL query `SELECT * FROM system:active_requests;` and it will list all those results.
* *system:completed_requests* - This catalog lists all the recent completed requests (that have run longer than some threshold of time, default of 1 second). You can execute `SELECT * FROM system:completed_requests;` and it will list these queries.

== New to N1QL: meta().plan

Before 5.0, both active_requests and completed_requests return not only the the N1QL query text, but also related information: request time, request id, execution time, scan consistency, and so on. This can be useful information. Here's an example that looks at a simple query (`select * from `travel-sample``) while it's running by executing `select * from system:active_requests;`

[source,JavaScript]

	"active_requests": {
	  "clientContextID": "805f519d-0ffb-4adf-bd19-15238c95900a",

	  "scanConsistency": "unbounded",
	  "state": "running",
	  "statement": "select * from `travel-sample`;"
	}
}

With the new `META().plan`, I can get more information about the query plan. This time, I'll execute `select *, meta().plan from system:active_requests`;

Note the new "plan" part. It contains a tree of operators that combine to execute the N1QL query. The root operator is a Sequence, which itself has a collection of child operators like Authorize, PrimaryScan, Fetch, and possibly even more Sequences.

I got the above output using the Query Workbench. The Query Workbench will automatically turn on profiling and timings, so you'll always be able to get those results.

To get them when using cbq or the REST API, you'll need to turn on the "profile" feature. Make a POST request to http://localhost:8093/admin/settings, using Basic authentication, and a JSON body like:

[source,JavaScript]
----
{
  "completed-limit": 4000,
  "completed-threshold": 1000,
  "controls": false,
  "cpuprofile": "",
  "debug": false,
  "keep-alive-length": 16384,
  "loglevel": "INFO",
  "max-parallelism": 1,
  "memprofile": "",
  "pipeline-batch": 16,
  "pipeline-cap": 512,
  "pretty": true,
  "profile": "timings",
  "request-size-cap": 67108864,
  "scan-cap": 0,
  "servicers": 32,
  "timeout": 0
}
----

Notice the *profile* setting. It was previously set to off, but I set it to "timings".

== Using the Query Workbench

There's a lot of information in `meta().id` about how the plan is executed. Personally, I prefer to look at a simplified graphical version of it in Query Workbench by clicking the "Plan" icon (which I briefly mentioned in a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/2017/january/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console[previous post about the new Couchbase Web Console] UI). 

image:054_01_Plan_Query_Workbench.jpg[Query Workbench plan results]

Let's look at a slightly more complex example. For this exercise, I'm using the travel-sample bucket, but I have removed one of the indexes (`DROP INDEX `travel-sample`.`def_sourceairport`;`).

I then execute a N1QL query to find flights between San Francisco and Miami:

[source,SQL]
----
SELECT r.id, a.name, s.flight, s.utc, r.sourceairport, r.destinationairport, r.equipment
FROM `travel-sample` r
UNNEST r.schedule s
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid
WHERE r.sourceairport = 'SFO'
AND r.destinationairport = 'MIA'
AND s.day = 0
ORDER BY a.name;
----

Executing this query (on my single-node local machine) takes about 10 seconds. That's definitely not an acceptible amount of time, so let's look at the plan to see what the problem might be (I broke it into two lines so the screenshots will fit in the blog post).

image:054_02_Plan_1.jpg[Query Workbench plan part 1]

image:054_03_Plan_2.jpg[Query Workbench plan part 2]

Looking at that plan, it seems like the costliest parts of the query are the *Filter* and the *Join*. `JOIN` operations work on keys, so they should normally be very quick. But it looks like there are a _lot_ of documents being joined.

The Filter (the `WHERE` part of the query) is also taking a lot of time. It's looking at the `sourceairport` and `destinationairport` fields. Looking elsewhere in the plan, I see that there is a *PrimaryScan*. This should be a red flag when you are trying to write performant queries. PrimaryScan means that the query couldn't find an index other than the primary index. This is roughly the equivalent of a "table scan" in relational database term. (You may want to drop the primary index so that these issues get bubbled-up faster, but that's a topic for another time).

Let's add an index on the `sourceairport` field and see if that helps.

[source,SQL]
----
CREATE INDEX `def_sourceairport` ON `travel-sample`(`sourceairport`);
----

Now, running the same query as above, I get the following plan:

image:054_04_Plan_improved_1.jpg[Query Workbench improved plan part 1]

image:054_05_Plan_improved_2.jpg[Query Workbench improved plan part 2]

This query took ~100ms (on my single-node local machine) which is much more acceptible. The *Filter* and the *Join* still take up a large percentage of the time, but thanks to the *IndexScan* replacing the *PrimaryScan*, there are many fewer documents that those operators have to deal with. Perhaps the query could be improved even more with an additional index on the `destinationairport` field.

== We want your feedback!

The new `META().plan` functionality and the new Plan UI combine in Couchbase Server 5.0 to improve the N1QL writing and profiling process.

Stay tuned to the link:http://blog.couchbase.com[Couchbase Blog] for information about what's coming in the new UI in the next developer build.

Interested in trying out some of these new features? link:https://couchbase.com/download[Download Couchbase Server 5.0] today!

We want feedback! Developer releases are coming every month, so you have a chance to make a difference in what we are building.

*Bugs*: If you find a bug (something that is broken or doesn't work how you'd expect), please file an issue in our link:https://issues.couchbase.com[JIRA system at issues.couchbase.com]. Or, contact me with a description of the issue. I would be happy to help you or submit the bug for you (my Couchbase handlers high-five me every time I submit a good bug).

*Feedback*: Let me know what you think. Something you don't like? Something you really like? Something missing? Now you can give feedback directly from within the Couchbase Web Console. Look for the image:054_06_feedback_icon.png[feedback icon] icon at the bottom right of the screen.

In some cases, it may be tricky to decide if your feedback is a bug or a suggestion. Use your best judgement, or again, feel free to contact me for help. I want to hear from you.
