= Connect 2016 Developer Workshop

For the first day of Couchbase Connect 2016, I created a full-day developer's workshop (with the help of our great SDK team, of course). It was great meeting some of our customers and helping people get up to speed with Couchbase Server. For those of you that couldn't make it, the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/workshop/tree/master/connect2016/developer[materials are all open sourced].

== Structure

The lab is broken into 4 parts:

1. **Setting up Couchbase**: install Couchbase Server locally, in Docker, or in Azure/Amazon.
2. **Using Couchbase**: getting familiar with the basic Couchbase tools and writing a "Hello, World" application.
3. **Building a Full-stack Application**: using Couchbase to write a RESTful API that an Angular 2 app communicated with.
4. **Creating a simple cluster**: create a 3-node cluster using Docker (though the same methods can be applied if you aren't using Docker)

== Slides

The first thing you'll want to do is read the slides. These should contain the instructions you need to proceed through the labs. In each folder, there is a Powerpoint (PPTX) file with the slides. If you don't have Powerpoint, let me know, and I'd be happy to provide them to you in another format. (I would add PDF files to the repository, but the risk is that they could get out of sync with the source PPTX files).

== Code

Only part 2 and 3 have code. In each part, there are samples for .NET, Java, and Node. There is a completed version, and a "fill in the blank" version. For instance, the "dotnet" folder has the completed source code for the .NET sample, while "dotnet_workshop" folder has a number of fill-in-the-blanks.

Part 3 contains an Angular 2 application. There's actually nothing specific to Couchbase in that Angular 2 code, so you can skip it, write your own frontend, or just interact with the endpoints directly using a tool like link:https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman] or link:http://www.telerik.com/fiddler[Fiddler].
