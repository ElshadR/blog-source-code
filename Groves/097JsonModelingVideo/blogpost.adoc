JSON modeling was covered in a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/json-data-modeling-rdbms-users/[previous blog post] which was, in turn, based on a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/csv-migrating-couchbase-relational/[CSV import blog post] that came before that. While writing the post on JSON modeling, it occurred to me that it might be useful to see all the data in motion: from relational, to CSV, to a staging bucket, and finally assembled with the new model.

A tool that I neglected to mention in any of these earlier posts is link:https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.2/[csvkit] and specifically link:http://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/1.0.2/scripts/csvsql.html?highlight=csvsql[csvsql]. This tool can pull CSV data from SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Sybase, and Firebird directly into CSV.
