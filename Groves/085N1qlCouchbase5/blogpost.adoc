N1QL enhancements have come to Couchbase. N1QL is one of the flagship features of Couchbase Server. The release of link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0] further bolsters N1QL with a range of enhancements.

Many of these enhancements have been covered in previous blog posts (such as link:https://blog.couchbase.com/n1ql-performance-feature-enhancements-couchbase-5-0/[Nic Raboy's post on performance enhancements]). This post won't cover all the N1QL enhancements. Check out link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/introduction/whats-new.html[What's New? in Couchbase] for the full scoop.

_Important notes: To follow along, you can install link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0] on your local machine. You can also explore *some* of these N1QL Enhancements without even installing Couchbase Server by checking out the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/learn-n1ql-10-minutes-interactive-online-tutorial/[10 minute online tutorial]. Also, this blog is being written with a release candidate build of Couchbase Server that may differ slightly from the actual release._

== N1QL Enhancements for RBAC

One of the biggest new features in Couchbase Server 5.0 is the built-in Role Based Access Control (RBAC). For the full story, you can check out link:https://blog.couchbase.com/authentication-authorization-rbac-net/[previous blog posts on RBAC].

But, from a N1QL enhancements point of view, there are two keywords you should know about: link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/grant.html#topic_11_5[GRANT] and link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/revoke.html#topic_11_5[REVOKE].

The documentation covers it well, but here's a quick example. I'll create a user "myuser", and give that user only one role: Data Reader on the "travel-sample" bucket.

I could edit that user in the UI to give them Data Writer.

=== GRANT and REVOKE

But here's how to do it with a `GRANT` N1QL command:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
GRANT data_writer
 ON `travel-sample`
 TO myuser;
----

After, you can navigate over to the "Security" section of Couchbase Console to see that "myuser" has the new permission.

You can find all of the role names (like "data_writer") in the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/security/concepts-rba-for-apps.html[5.0 documentation].

`REVOKE` works the same way, but in reverse.

=== `system` keyspaces for RBAC

There are a couple of link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/monitoring/monitoring-n1ql-query.html[new system keyspaces] that you can use from N1QL now as well. `SELECT * FROM system:user_info` will return information about each user and their roles.

image:08503-user-info-keyspace.png[User info keyspace]

You can use `SELECT * FROM system:applicable_roles` keyspace to get a list of all the role information.

Note that only Adminstrators and users with a "Query System Catalog" role themselves have access to these keyspaces.

== curl

As link:https://blog.couchbase.com/curl-comes-n1ql-querying-external-json-data/[Isha blogged about earlier], you can now use a CURL function from N1QL to query external JSON data. There are definitely security implications when using CURL, so make sure to read the full link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/curl.html#topic_8_8[N1QL CURL documentation] before you decide to use this N1QL enhancement.

Before I can demonstrate in this post, I have to add a URL to a whitelist. On Windows, this is done by creating a file in the /var/lib/couchbase/n1qlcerts folder (I had to create the n1qlcerts folder myself too) called curl_whitelist.json. _The full default path for your reference is: C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\n1qlcerts\curl_whitelist.json._

I created a file with a single URL entry (swapi.co is the Star Wars API):

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
	"all_access": false,
	"allowed_urls": ["https://swapi.co"]
}
----

Then, you can use the `CURL` function from with a N1QL query to retrieve JSON data. You could retrieve a single planet, for instance, with https://swapi.co/api/planets/3/, or you could retrieve all the planets (which is what I did):

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT p.name, p.climate, p.residents
FROM CURL("https://swapi.co/api/planets/").results as p;
----

That endpoint returns 10 planets at a time. I'm narrowing it just to the `results` field, and to the name, climate, and residents.

Note that introducing CURL to a query also introduces other issues: you are yielding performance and reliability to the external data source. Also note that you can use CURL on Couchbase Server's own REST API, which opens up a lot of interesting possibilities.
