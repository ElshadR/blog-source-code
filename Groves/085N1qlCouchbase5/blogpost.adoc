N1QL enhancements have come to Couchbase. N1QL is one of the flagship features of Couchbase Server. The release of link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0] further bolsters N1QL with a range of enhancements.

Many of these enhancements have been covered in previous blog posts (such as link:https://blog.couchbase.com/n1ql-performance-feature-enhancements-couchbase-5-0/[Nic Raboy's post on performance enhancements]). This post won't cover all the N1QL enhancements. Check out link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/introduction/whats-new.html[What's New? in Couchbase] for the full scoop.

_Important notes: To follow along, you can install link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server 5.0] on your local machine. You can also explore *some* of these N1QL Enhancements without even installing Couchbase Server by checking out the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/learn-n1ql-10-minutes-interactive-online-tutorial/[10 minute online tutorial]. Also, this blog is being written with a release candidate build of Couchbase Server that may differ slightly from the actual release._

== N1QL Enhancements for RBAC

One of the biggest new features in Couchbase Server 5.0 is the built-in Role Based Access Control (RBAC). For the full story, you can check out link:https://blog.couchbase.com/authentication-authorization-rbac-net/[previous blog posts on RBAC].

But, from a N1QL enhancements point of view, there are two keywords you should know about: link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/grant.html#topic_11_5[GRANT] and link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/revoke.html#topic_11_5[REVOKE].

The documentation covers it well, but here's a quick example. I'll create a user "myuser", and give that user only one role: Data Reader on the "travel-sample" bucket.

image:08501-create-user.png[Create a user]

I could edit that user in the UI to give them Data Writer.

=== GRANT and REVOKE

But here's how to do it with a `GRANT` N1QL command:

[source,sql,indent=0]
----
GRANT data_writer
 ON `travel-sample`
 TO myuser;
----

After, you can navigate over to the "Security" section of Couchbase Console to see that "myuser" has the new permission.

image:08502-grant-user-role-n1ql-enhancements.png[GRANT a role to a user as a N1QL enhancement]

You can find all of the role names (like "data_writer") in the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/security/concepts-rba-for-apps.html[5.0 documentation].

`REVOKE` works the same way, but in reverse.

=== `system` keyspaces for RBAC

There are a couple of link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/monitoring/monitoring-n1ql-query.html[new system keyspaces] that you can use from N1QL now as well. `SELECT * FROM system:user_info` will return information about each user and their roles.

image:08503-user-info-keyspace.png[User info keyspace]

You can use `SELECT * FROM system:applicable_roles` keyspace to get a list of all the role information.

Note that only Adminstrators and users with a "Query System Catalog" role themselves have access to these keyspaces.

== curl

As link:https://blog.couchbase.com/curl-comes-n1ql-querying-external-json-data/[Isha blogged about earlier], you can now use a CURL function from N1QL to query external JSON data. There are definitely security implications when using CURL, so make sure to read the full link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/curl.html#topic_8_8[N1QL CURL documentation] before you decide to use this N1QL enhancement.

Before I can demonstrate in this post, I have to add a URL to a whitelist. On Windows, this is done by creating a file in the /var/lib/couchbase/n1qlcerts folder (I had to create the n1qlcerts folder myself too) called curl_whitelist.json. _The full default path for your reference is: C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\var\lib\couchbase\n1qlcerts\curl_whitelist.json._

I created a file with a single URL entry (swapi.co is the Star Wars API):

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
	"all_access": false,
	"allowed_urls": ["https://swapi.co"]
}
----

Then, you can use the `CURL` function from with a N1QL query to retrieve JSON data. You could retrieve a single planet, for instance, with https://swapi.co/api/planets/3/, or you could retrieve all the planets (which is what I did):

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT p.name, p.climate, p.residents
FROM CURL("https://swapi.co/api/planets/").results as p;
----

That endpoint returns 10 planets at a time. I'm narrowing it just to the `results` field, and to the name, climate, and residents.

Note that introducing CURL to a query also introduces other issues: you are yielding performance and reliability to the external data source. Also note that you can use CURL on Couchbase Server's own REST API, which opens up a lot of interesting possibilities.

== Indexes

As always, good indexing is vital to getting optimal performance from your N1QL queries. There are a lot of index options in Couchbase Server, which I won't cover in this blog post. Definitely link:https://blog.couchbase.com/gear-n1ql-era-engagement-databases/[check out this blog post from Prasad Varakur] and also look at some of the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/performance/index_pushdowns.html[optimizations] that have been added to Couchbase in version 5.0.

For this post, I'm just going to touch on the new *adaptive indexes* and *equivalent indexes*.

=== Adaptive Indexes

In previous versions of Couchbase, if you wanted to index combinations of fields, you had to create an index for each combination. For example, if I plan to write queries that check "type" and "name" field together or the "type" and "age" field together, that would require two compound indexes: one for `type,name` and one for `type,state`.

Consider this query:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT l.*
FROM `travel-sample` l
WHERE l.type='landmark'
AND l.state='California';
----

In the default `travel-sample` bucket, the `type` field is indexed, but not the state. This query works, but notice how flat the query plan is:

image:08505-index-no-adaptive.png[Query without adaptive index]

Also notice that the "fetch" and "filter" steps have to process almost 4500 documents.

Adaptive indexes make it easier to write indexes that better support adhoc querying. They can be used to index specified fields or all fields of a document.

A new keyword introduced to N1QL is `SELF`. It can create an adaptive index on all fields in all 'landmark' documents in the travel-sample bucket like so:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX `ai_n1ql_enhancements` 
    ON `travel-sample`(DISTINCT PAIRS(SELF)) 
    WHERE type = 'landmark';
----

_You can also specify individual fields you want to index instead of `SELF`._

After creating this index, run the above `SELECT` query again.

image:08506-index-with-adaptive.png[Query with adaptive index]

Notice the extra index scanning that's occurring to accommodate the `state` field that it's querying on. Also notice that "filter" and "fetch" are working through fewer documents: only 1900. With the relative small size of the "travel-sample" bucket, this is an overall small savings. With a _real_ bucket containing millions of documents, the time saved can be significant.

Further, as your queries grow more complex, link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/adaptive-indexing.html[adaptive indexes] will save you work while still giving you a performance boost.

=== Index Replicas

If you are making heavy use of N1QL in your application, you may want to create multiple indexes that get distributed across your cluster. This can improve performance, load balancing, and availability.

Until Couchbase Server 5, the way you did this was to create multiple identical indexes with different name. As Venkat covered in this link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-index-replicas/[earlier blog post on index replicas], there are some drawbacks to that.

So, in Couchbase Server 5, index replicas have been introduced. When creating an index, simply use a `num_replica` setting to specify how many replica indexes you want to create.

Here's an index on the `state` field that I was using earlier in the "travel-sample" bucket. In this case, I'm going to replicate it twice.

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX `ix_state`
    ON `travel-sample`(state)
    WHERE state IS NOT MISSING
    WITH {"num_replica":2};
----

Note that in order for this to work, you'll need at least three nodes running the index service (1 for the index, 2 for the replicas).

After running the above query (on a 3 node cluster), click "Indexes". You should see "ix_state" show up 3 times on three nodes. Two of them are marked "replica".

image:08506-index-replicas.png[Index replicas]

_You can also specify the exact nodes you want the replicas on by specifying IP addresses in `CREATE INDEX`._

Couchbase will take care of the rest for you. Index replicas will be used for incoming queries.
