ArangoDb is the focus of the latest episode of The NoSQL Database Podcast. Max Neunhoeffer joins as the special guest to talk about this multi-model NoSQL document database.

The previous episode of the podcast was link:https://blog.couchbase.com/ndp-episode-22-couchbase-engagement-nosql-database/[Couchbase, the Engagement NoSQL Database with Justin Michaels].

This is a special episode of the podcast! Nic Raboy will no longer be hosting the show, so this is my first episode as the host. Nic joins as a special guest to make sure we have a smooth transition.

Episode 23 can be found on all the major podcasting networks such as iTunes and Pocket Casts. I've also embedded the recording below.
