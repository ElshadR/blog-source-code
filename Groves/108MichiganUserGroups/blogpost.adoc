Michigan user groups: watch out! I'll be spending a solid week at in your state! I'll be talking about the tech I'm most enthusiastic about, including: link:https://couchbase.com/downloads[Couchbase Server], .NET, C#.

If you're anywhere in Michigan (lower peninsula, sorry link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yooper[Yoopers]), you should definitely get to one of these groups and network with fellow developers.

== May 14th: West Michigan .NET Users Group

The first of the Michigan user groups I'll be at is the link:https://www.meetup.com/wmdotnet/[West Michigan .NET Users Group]. I'll be presenting link:https://www.meetup.com/wmdotnet/events/250411803/[5 Popular Choices for NoSQL on a Microsoft Platform], which will highlight Couchbase, of course, compared to some of the other choices out there.

== May 15th: Ann Arbor .NET Developers Group

The next of the Michigan user groups is in the forbidden city of link:https://www.meetup.com/aadndevs/[Ann Arbor] (forbidden because I live in Columbus, Ohio, and well, link:https://www.12up.com/posts/4126934-6-best-woody-hayes-quotes-about-michigan-rivalry[you know]). At this group, they've asked me to link:https://www.meetup.com/aadndevs/events/249349717/[speak about Aspect-Oriented Programming], which I don't use much anymore, but I did write a book about it once. I'm sure some Couchbase stuff will sneak into the presentation.

== May 16th: Great Lakes Area .NET Users Group

The Michigan user groups tour rolls on with one of my favorite, seminal .NET user groups. This one is in the Detroit area: link:https://www.meetup.com/Great-Lakes-Area-NET-User-Group-GANG/events/swhmmpyxhbvb/[Great Lakes Area .NET Users Group]. If you've never been to a GANG meeting, you're missing out! I'll again be presenting "5 Popular Choices for NoSQL on a Microsoft Platform".

_One of my personal traditions/rituals is to hand-draw a doodle of each user group/meetup/conference logo (or some variation of it) that I attend or speak at. This logo is a combination of "Pure Michigan", which is the state tourism motto (also on the license plates) and the MIGANG logo._

== May 17th: Greater Lansing .NET User Group

Finally, I'm going to end the tour in the state capital at the link:https://www.meetup.com/GLUGnet/[Greater Lansing .NET User Group]. Once again, I'll be presenting link:https://www.meetup.com/GLUGnet/events/qkmgpkyxhbwb/[5 Popular Choices for NoSQL on a Microsoft Platform].

== I'll see you at these Michigan user groups!

If you think I'll be giving the exact same presentation 3 times, think again! User groups generally provide more time for audience questions, participation, and improvisation. I sometimes change the entire direction of a presentation mid-course. I may end up diving deeper into querying (like link:http://couchbase.com/n1ql[N1QL]) in one session, text-based search in another, and CAP theorem in another.

It all depends on you. Support your local user group, bring your burning questions, come and learn about NoSQL, meet some great people, and let's have some fun!

I'll see you there: I'm on link:https://twitter.com/mgroves[Twitter @mgroves].
