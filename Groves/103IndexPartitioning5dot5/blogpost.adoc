Index partitioning is a new feature available in Couchbase Server 5.5. 

Check out the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/announcing-couchbase-server-5-5-developer-build/[Couchbase Server 5.5 announcement], and link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads?family=server&product=couchbase-server-developer&edition=enterprise[download the developer build] for free right now.

In this post, I'm going to cover:

* Why you might want to use index partitioning
* An example of how to do it
* Some caveats to be careful with

== Index partitioning

When developing you application, you may want to take advantage of Couchbase Server's ease of scaling to give more resources to indexing. With link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/clustersetup/services-mds.html[multi-dimensional scaling (MDS)], one option is that you can add multiple high-end machines to the cluster with index capabilities as you need them.

To take advantage of multiple nodes with index services, you would have to create link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-index-replicas/[index replicas]. This is still possible, and if this is working for you, it's not going away.

But Couchbase Server 5.5 is introducing another way to spread the index load around: index partitioning. Instead of replicating an index, you can now split up the index amongst the nodes with hashing.

And, you can use partitioning and replicas together in concert. So, much like documents, index partitions can be recovered from replicas if a node goes down.

The primary benefits to index partitioning is that the index scan load is now balanced amongst all the index nodes. This leads to a more even distribution of work and better performance.

== How to use index partitioning

The syntax for creating an index partition is `PARTITION BY HASH(<field>)`. For example, if I wanted to create a compound index on the "travel-sample" bucket for fields airline, flight, source_airport, and destination_airport:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX ix_route ON `travel-sample` (airline, flight, source_airport, destination_airport) PARTITION BY HASH(airline);
----

When you create this index, it will show as "partitioned" in the Couchbase Console.

For more information about `PARTITION BY`, check out the Couchbase documentation.

== Index partitioning caveats

You may have noticed that "airline" was used in the above `CREATE INDEX` command. When using index partitioning, you must specify one (or more fields) to give to the hash to use for partitioning. This hash will determine how to divide up the index.

The simplest thing you can do is use the document key in the hash.

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX ix_route2 ON `travel-sample` (airline, flight, source_airport, destination_airport) PARTITION BY HASH(META().Id);
----

You can, however, use whatever fields you like. But you must keep in mind that these fields should be considered *immutable*. That is, you shouldn't change the value of the fields. Couchbase Server will __not__ prevent you from doing so, but if you do, you are likely to end up with documents that have duplicate indexes. So, if you have a field with a value that does not typically change (many Couchbase users create a "type" field, for instance), that would be a good candidate for partitioning.

If you choose to index on an "immutable" field, be warned that this may also cause some skewing of the partition. If you partition on the "type" field, where 10% of documents have a type of "order" and 90% of documents have a type of "invoice", then the partition is likely to look similar. Index partitioning does not take into account the proportion of the data; it only takes into account the proportion of the resources (RAM and CPU) available on each node.

One more caveat: *index partitioning is an Enterprise Edition only feature*.

== Summary

Index partitioning allows you to more easily and automatically scale out your indexing capabilities. If you are using a lot of N1QL queries in your project, then this will come in very handy and make your job much easier.
