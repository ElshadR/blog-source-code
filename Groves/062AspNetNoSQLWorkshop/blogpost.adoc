I delivered an ASP.NET with NoSQL workshop at the recent link:https://indycode.amegala.com/[Indy.Code() conference in Indianapolis]. I had a lot of fun at this conference, and I recommend you go next year. If you were unable to attend, don't worry, because I've got the next best thing for you: all the material that I used in my workshop.

== ASP.NET Workshop in 4 parts

This workshop contained four main parts:

* Install a NoSQL database (Couchbase Server)
* Interact with Couchbase Server (using both the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/a-tour-of-the-new-couchbase-web-console-video/[Web Console] and the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/introducing-couchbase-net-2-4-0-net-core-ga/[.NET (or .NET Core) SDK])
* Create a RESTful API using ASP.NET (or ASP.NET Core) WebAPI
* Consume the RESTful API with an Angular frontend

== Try it yourself
