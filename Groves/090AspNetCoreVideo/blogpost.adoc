ASP.NET Core is the newest development platform for Microsoft developers. If you are looking for information about plain old ASP.NET, check out link:https://blog.couchbase.com/asp-net-couchbase-getting-started/[ASP.NET with Couchbase: Getting Started].

== ASP.NET Core Tools to Get Started

The following video will take you from having no code to having an HTTP REST API that uses Couchbase Server, built with ASP.NET Core.
