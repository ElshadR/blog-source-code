Proof of concept may be just what you need to start when you're evaluating Couchbase.

We've been blogging a lot about the technical side of moving from a relational database like Oracle or SQL Server to Couchbase. For this post, we're going to talk more about the when/why than the how.

In this post, you'll see five steps to creating a successful proof of concept. And if you ever need help getting started, you can link:https://info.couchbase.com/Contact_Solutions_Engineer.html[talk to a Couchbase Solutions Engineer].

== Proof of Concept steps

These steps are not just for migrating an existing application away from a database to Couchbase, they also work just as well for creating a brand new "greenfield" application with Couchbase, or even augmenting an existing database (as opposed to replacing completely).

=== Select a use case and application

When I speak at events, I tell people that I want them to use Couchbase. But, the only thing worse than them _not_ using Couchbase is using Couchbase for the wrong thing and becoming soured on document databases.

The benefits of a distributed database like Couchbase are:

* Better performance
* Better scalability
* Higher availability
* Greater data agility/flexibility
* Improved operational management

If your application can benefit from one of those criteria, it's worth checking out Couchbase. Couchbase may not be the best fit if you need multi-document transactions. But remember, as I showed in my post on link:https://blog.couchbase.com/author/matthew-groves/[data modeling], if you choose to nest data instead of scattering it in pieces, you may not need multi-document transactions as much as you think.

Some use cases that Couchbase has been a great fit for include:

* Product Catalog
* Asset Tracking
* Content Management
* Application Configuration
* Customer Management
* File or Streaming Metadata Service

=== Define the success criteria

Once you've decided that you have a use case that would be good for Couchbase, you need to define what it means for a proof of concept to be successful.

Examples of criteria:

* *Performance/latency improvements* - This might boil down to a number, like "5ms latency in the 95th percentile".
* *Ease of scaling* - How easy is it to scale now? How much time does it take a person? How many 2am Saturdays do you need someone to do upgrades?
* *Faster development cycles* - Does schema management eat up a lot of time in your sprint? A proof of concept with Couchbase can help to demonstrate if a flexible model is going to save you time.

Whatever the criteria, it's good to define it at the beginning, so you can work towards trying to achieve that. A vague goal like "I just want to play around with NoSQL" is fine for an individual developer, but a well-defined success criteria is going to be critical when presenting to decision makers.

=== Understand your data

As I covered in the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/json-data-modeling-rdbms-users/[JSON data modeling post], it's important for you to understand your data before you even start writing any code. You need to understand what you are going to model and how your application need to function.

If you plan to migrate data, it's better to start by thinking about how it would look independent of how it's currently stored. Draw out a concept of it on a whiteboard without using "tables" or "documents". Migrating from relational to document database is not going to be a purely mechanical exercise.

=== Identify the access patterns

I also covered this in my link:https://blog.couchbase.com/json-data-modeling-rdbms-users/[JSON data modeling post]. Couchbase is very flexible in the way that it can store data. But, the data model can be accessed depending on what access patterns are necessary.

In that blog post, I layed out some rules of thumb for nested/seperate documents. At a higher level, you can start with thinking about data access like this:

* *Key/value* - The ability to get/change a document based on its key. This is the fastest, lowest latency method available in Couchbase.
* *N1QL query* - N1QL is SQL for JSON data, available in Couchbase. It can query data just about any way you can imagine. Most importantly, you can query data based on something _other_ than its key.
* *Full Text Search* - When you need to query based on text in a language aware way. Great for user driven searches, for instance.
* *Map/Reduce* - Writing a pure function to calculate query results ahead of time. N1QL is taking a lot of these use cases away from M/R, but it's still good for some specialized type of aggregation.
* *Geospatial* - Querying of documents based on some geographical/location based information.
* *Analytics/reporting* - Couchbase Analytics (currently in preview) can give you heavily indexed non-operational access to your data. You can run complex reports without impacting day-to-day users.

=== Review the architecure

At the end of your proof of concept, you can measure your results against the criteria that you created at the very beginning.

It might be a good idea to iterate on this proof on concept: you can apply what you've leaned in each subsequent iteration. If you keep the iterations short, you can learn what you've applied faster. This isn't just true of Couchbase, by the way, but anything!

Finally, if your proof of concept is a success (and I know it will be), then it's time to prepare for production. Take the time to review the architecture, the decisions you've made, what worked well, what didn't work well, and so on. The more you document, the more the rest of your team and organization can learn from for the next project.
