ACID properties are a topic that I get asked about a lot. Generally, people ask in the context of transactions: "Are there NoSQL transactions?", "Can I use ACID transactions in Couchbase?", and so on. But there is more to ACID than just a database transaction capability.

## Couchbase and Transactions

Scaling, performance, and flexibility have been the core focus of the Couchbase data platform, and transactions are often at odds with these characteristics. 

This blog post is going to cover the building blocks of ACID that *are* available in Couchbase. These "primitives" can be used without sacrificing the overall scaling, performance, and flexibility of Couchbase. Depending on your use case, these primitives might be adequate on their own, or in concert with eachother.

There are a couple of things I want to assert:

1. A NoSQL database like Couchbase is not always the right choice for every situation
2. For use cases where NoSQL *is* appropriate, a minority truly need a full transaction support.

Currently, Couchbase does not claim multi-document transaction support, which is what most developers think of when they think of ACID. But, in part 2 of this series, I will show an approach that uses these building blocks to provide an approach to doing transactions with Couchbase.

## What are the ACID properties?

ACID stands for: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. It was coined in the 1980s and describes a class of database operation that provides safety guarantees. At the time, relational databases and the SQL language were 
History of acronym. CB provides primitives to help you solve your problem while not sacrificing the benefits of a distributed db.

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

In the Intro, we should emphasize that Couchbase is a Strongly Consistent NoSQL database (the C in ACID is different from the NoSQL Consistency). Some competitors (Aerospike specifically) are trying to use Strong Consistency as implying transactionality (admittedly some Durability aspects are implied by strong consistency), so we should clearly state that we are Strongly Consistent (there are corner cases where we are not, but for all practical purposes we are strongly consistent â€“ of course this part does not need to go in the blog). We want to use this blog to drive this message as well.

## A is for Atomicity

A: Individual documents ops are atomic. Show example of relational normalized that needs atomicity across multiple tables and why that isn't as necessary in a document db with a hierarchical document.

## C is for Consistency

C: Consistency of N1QL queries. Short RequestPlus example in .net. Link to AtPlus blog post.

## I is for Isolation

I: Pessimistic and optimistic locking. Short CAS explanation. Short .net sample

## D is for Durability

D: short Review of CB memory-first arch. PersistTo and ReplicateTo. Short example in .net

## Summary

leverage primitives when necessary without sacrificing benefits of distributed. Short preview of next post on two-phase commit. Links to forums, twitter, etc.
