New querying features figure prominently in the latest release of Couchbase Server 5.5. The link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads[developer build is now available as a free download].

In this post, I want to highlight a few of the new features and show you how to get started using them:

* ANSI JOINs - N1QL in Couchbase already has JOIN, but now JOIN is more standards compliant and more flexible.
* HASH joins - Performance on certain types of joins can be improved with a HASH join (in Enterprise Edition only)
* Aggregate pushdowns - GROUP BY can be pushed down to the indexer, improving aggregation performance

_All the examples in this post use the "travel-sample" bucket that comes with Couchbase._

== ANSI JOINs

Until Couchbase Server 5.5, JOINs were possible, with two caveats:

* One side of the JOIN has to be document key(s)
* You must use the `ON KEYS` syntax

In Couchbase Server 5.5, it is no longer necessary to use `ON KEYS`, and so writing joins becomes much more natural and more in line with other SQL dialects.

For example, here's the old syntax:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT r.destinationairport, r.sourceairport, r.distance, r.airlineid, a.name
FROM `travel-sample` r
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON KEYS r.airlineid
WHERE r.type = 'route'
AND r.sourceairport = 'CMH'
ORDER BY r.distance DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

This will get 10 routes that start at CMH airport, joined with their corresponding airline documents. The result are below (I'm showing them in table view, but it's still JSON):

And here's the new syntax doing the same thing:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT r.destinationairport, r.sourceairport, r.distance, r.airlineid, a.name
FROM `travel-sample` r
JOIN `travel-sample` a ON META(a).id = r.airlineid
WHERE r.type = 'route'
AND r.sourceairport = 'CMH'
ORDER BY r.distance DESC
LIMIT 10;
----

The only difference is the `ON`. Instead of `ON KEYS`, it's now `ON <field1> = <field2>`. It's more natural for those coming from a relational background (like myself).

But that's not all. Now you are no longer limited to joining just on document keys. Here's an example of a `JOIN` on a city field.

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT a.airportname, a.city AS airportCity, h.name AS hotelName, h.city AS hotelCity, h.address AS hotelAddress
FROM `travel-sample` a
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` h ON h.city = a.city
WHERE a.type = 'airport'
AND h.type = 'hotel'
LIMIT 10;
----

This query will show hotels that match airports based on their city.

Note that for this to work, you must have an index created on the field that's on the inner side of the JOIN. The "travel-sample" bucket already contains a predefined index on the city field. If I were to attempt it with other fields, I'd get an error message like "No index available for ANSI join term...".

For more information on ANSI JOIN, check out the link://[full N1QL JOIN documentation].

_Note: The old JOIN, ON KEYS syntax will still work, so don't worry about having to update your old code._

== Hash Joins

Under the covers, there are a few different ways that a join is actually carried out. If you run the query above, Couchbase will use a Nested Loop (NL) approach to execute the join. However, you can also instruct Couchbase to use a HASH join instead. If you want to try a hash join, you must explicitly say so in your query. For instance: 

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT COUNT(1)
FROM `travel-sample` r
INNER JOIN `travel-sample` a USE HASH (BUILD)
    ON (r.airlineid = META(a).id)
WHERE r.type = 'route';
----

Notice the usage and placement of the `USE HASH` keywords. This will tell Couchbase to __attempt__ a hash join. If it cannot do so (or if you are using Couchbase Server Community Edition), it will fall back to a nested-loop. (By the way, you can explicitly specify nested-loop with the `USE NL` syntax).

--- TODO: why would I use hash build, hash probe, or not? ---

For more information, check out the link://[HASH join] areas of the documentation.

== Aggregate pushdowns

Aggregations in the past have been tricky when it comes to performance. With Couchbase Server 5.5, __aggregate pushdowns__ are now supported for `SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, and AVG`.

In earlier versions of Couchbase, indexing was not used for statements involving `GROUP BY`. This could severely impact performance, because there is an extra "grouping" step that has to take place. In Couchbase Server 5.5, the index service can do the grouping/aggregation.

Here's an example query that finds the total number of hotels, and groups them by country, state, and city.

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT country, state, city, COUNT(1) AS total 
FROM `travel-sample`
WHERE type = 'hotel' and country is not null
GROUP BY country, state, city
ORDER BY COUNT(1) DESC;
----

The query will execute, and it will return as a result:

image:10203-aggregate-result.png[Aggregation result]

Let's take a look at the visual query plan (only available in Enterprise Edition, but you can view the raw Plan Text in Community Edition).

image:10204-query-plan-no-pushdown.png[Query plan with no pushdown]

Note that the only index being used is for the `type` field. The grouping step is doing the aggregation work. With the relatively small travel-sample data set, this query is taking around ~90ms on my single node desktop. But let's see what happens if I add an index on the fields that I'm grouping by:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE INDEX ix_hotelregions ON `travel-sample` (country, state, city) WHERE type='hotel';
----

Now, execute the above `SELECT` query again. It should return the same results. But:

* It's now taking ~7ms on my single node desktop. We're taking ms, but with a large, more realistic data set, that is a huge difference in magnitude.
* The query plan is different.

image:10205-query-plan-with-pushdown.png[Query plan with pushdown]

Note that this time, there is no 'group' step. All the work is being pushed down to the index service, which can use the ix_hotelregions index. It can use this index because my query is exactly matching the fields in the index.

Index push down does not always happen: your query has to meet specific conditions. For more information, check out the link://[GROUP BY and Aggregate performance] areas of the documentation.
