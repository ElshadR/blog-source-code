== A Full Stack Application Built Using the Couchbase Data Platform

This past year, at the annual Couchbase Connect conference in Silicon Valley, 
we were proud to present a technical demonstration showing much of
the breadth of the {CDP} capabilities.  This included:

* Data storage and manipulation in {CBS-}[operational], {CAS-}[analytical], and {CBM-}[mobile] contexts
* IoT data moving from sensor to server to web client
* {CBL-}[Cross-platform mobile device local data persistence] with {SG-}[automatic synchronization]
* Event-driven web UI using the {CES}
* Live schema changes with no down time/migration 
* SQL-style dynamic queries with {N1QL}
* {FTS} with stemming, fuzzy matching, and facets
* Combining in-database with on-the-fly REST results retrieved with N1QL's link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/curl.html[cURL] capability
* Large-scale ad hoc {CAS-}[data analytics] with no ETL
* link:https://www.couchbase.com/multi-dimensional-scalability-overview[Multi-Dimensional Scaling] of the working clusters
* Easy hosting with popular cloud providers^link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=1a064a14-5ac2-4980-9167-15746aabde72[1]^^link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/couchbase.couchbase-enterprise[2]^^link:https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/partners/couchbase-public[3]^
* Automatic replication of data with {XDCR}
* {hadr}[Cluster failover]

and more.

That's a lot to take in.

Personally, I was super excited to be part of building this project.  It's hard to
understand the real scope without seeing it in action.  Take a look at this video.

== Project Source Code

I'm happy to announce the code base is now {cc17repo-}[open-source
and available on GitHub].  This includes sample data suitable for demonstrating on a single machine.
(Scaling to the size of the actual demo isn't feasible with GitHub!)  You'll be
able to try out the whole thing and see how each piece works.

There are shell scripts as well.
These aim to simplify setting up the entire demo.  They use Docker to allow setting up multiple
clusters.  (Read about cluster setup with Docker link:https://blog.couchbase.com/simplified-couchbase-server-cluster-creation-via-docker/[here].)
You can run an entire multi-data center example on one machine.

== Exploring the Code

In an upcoming series of blog posts, we will go into detail on all aspects
of the demo.  This will include an architectural review, setting up and running all the elements, and deep dives into
many parts of the source code.  We'll look at everything from the NFC temperature
patch through to the Vue.js-based web client.

The code and supporting files are still a work in progress.  Feel free to enter issues, pull requests, and ping us with questions.
