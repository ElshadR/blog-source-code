For the Couchbase Connect Silicon Valley conference last fall we built one of
the most extensive demonstrations of the {CDP} capabilities ever using a combined
web and mobile application.  The application incorporates dynamic N1QL queries,
offline mobile, IoT sensors, ad hoc queries with analytics, cross-data center
replication, failover, fuzzy text matching, and a slew of other features.  In
short, we aimed to show the core of a complete, realistic use, based on a real
data standard (link:https://www.hl7.org/fhir/overview.html[FHIR]) used in
healthcare.  Check out the video from the conference link:https://youtu.be/-U_UjqnhMBI[here].

A deployment of this complexity necessarily requires quite a bit of setup.  Along
with the {cc17repo-}[source code] for the project, I've included both regular
shell scripts and scripts to use with link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to simplify
running the demo yourself.

Sometimes seeing it all put together by hand is really helpful, though.  With that
in mind, I made a video showing every step needed to configure the demo.  I go
quickly, and sped up parts to get it all crunched in to 15 minutes.  (Realistically,
even with practice, it takes about 1/2 an hour.)
