During Couchbase Connect Silicon Valley last Fall, we went through an extensive
demonstration application that showed many of the capabilities of the {CDP}.
You can see the full video of the demonstration link:https://youtu.be/-U_UjqnhMBI[here].

In some parts of the video it's a little difficult to see exactly what's going on.
We're making some follow-on ones to help with that.

This first video takes a close-up look at the NFC battery-less temperature sensing
patch.  It also highlights the automatic sync capabilities of {CBM}.

There will be related posts looking at the source code for reading the patch.
There is also a soft-entry version that lets you run the application without
having an actual patch.  See the upcoming video and posts about configuring
the demo understand how to use that.

You can read about the patch on the Texas Instruments website link:http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDM-RF430-TEMPSENSE#technicaldocuments[here].
Programming information is available in the link:http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau603b/slau603b.pdf[Firmware User's Guide].

You can order the patch through link:https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Texas-Instruments/RF430-TMPSNS-EVM?qs=LuYMPh7GGMQNdxPRpX2qbg%3D%3D[Mouser Electronics].  There may be other sources.  That's just where I was
able to get them.
