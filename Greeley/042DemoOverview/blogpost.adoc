Last Fall we showed a 30 minute live demo of a full stack application written
using a broad range of the {CDP} capabilities.  This was at
the Couchbase Connect Silicon Valley 2017 conference.  

In this link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-data-platform-connect-2017-technical-demo/[introductory post],
I highlighted most of what we showed.  The post includes pointers for more information,
and to the project source code.  If you haven't seen the demo video yet, or read about
the project, I'd suggest taking a look at that post first.

== High-Level Architecture

With this post I want to kick off the deep dives into the technical aspects of the demo.
Let's take a look at the overall architecture.  Here's a diagram of it for reference.

== Web Application Components

The web side is pretty standard.  We have a web client written using Vue.js.
The server side runs in Node.js.  The Node server exposes all the REST
endpoints needed by the client, and handles the communication with {CBS}.

There are some less common pieces, like using Server Sent Events together with
the {CES}.  This allows pushing data to the client instead
of polling the database.

== Mobile/IoT Application Components

Working up through the other side, the architecture is more unique.

First off,
there's the temperature sensor.  For this we used a link:http://www.ti.com/tool/TIDM-RF430-TEMPSENSE[battery-less NFC patch]
made by Texas Instruments.  We read in temperatures using an NFC-enabled phone.
This data gets stored in the mobile app's built-in {CBL} database.
That let's us easily record readings while the phone is online or off.

To sync the readings, {CBL} connects to Couchbase {SG}.
Sync Gateway is specially designed to be a cloud-edge service, and core to
making the sync process easy.

Among other things, Sync Gateway handles moving the data into a {Bucket}.
During the demo we also make a schema change on the fly.  The changes
automatically transfer down to the phone.  That's also managed by Sync Gateway.

== Video

If you like, you can also find out more in this video walk-through.  I talk
a bit about the {CDP} capabilities used in the demo as well.
