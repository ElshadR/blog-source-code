This post will dive into the use of the {CES} in the Couchbase Silicon Valley 2017 link:https://youtu.be/-U_UjqnhMBI[technical keynote demonstration] application.

If you aren't already familiar with the demo or {CES}, take a look at the resources at the end of this post. The source code for the entire application set is {cc17repo-}[available on GitHub].

== Introduction

In the demo, we use a mobile phone with NFC to read temperatures from a battery-less patch.
The readings get stored as a link:https://www.hl7.org/fhir/observation.html[FHIR Observation Resource] in JSON using {CBL}.
These documents then get synced to a {CBS} cluster via {SG}.

The web client has a dashboard designed to track patient information in near real time.
This presents a couple of pretty common challenges.  How do we:

* Update the dashboard based on records written by another part of the system 
* Efficiently transfer the necessary information

Let's take a look at how the Eventing Service helps with both of these.

== Pushing Updates to the Client

Even without an link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_database[active database], you can do this at least a couple of different ways.
For example, we could work out a way to post the readings to a message queue, or poll the database.
Both approaches have drawbacks.

* Adding a message queue introduces more infrastructure complexity and opportunities for failure.
* Polling is, well, polling.

Instead, we handled this using https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.5/eventing/eventing-overview.html[Couchbase Functions], a feature of the Eventing Service.
Functions listen for changes in the database.
(Technically, Functions process a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbases-history-everything-dcp/[Couchbase Database Change Protocol] feed.)
You then write two callbacks in JavaScript, `OnUpdate` and `OnDelete`, that get invoked for every document creation/update  and deletion event, respectively.
This lets you implement reactive code that runs directly in your cluster.

(On a side note, we could have solved this using link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/current/guides/sync-gateway/server-integration/index.html[Sync Gateway web hooks].
This approach has some aspects in common with the technique we did use.
It has several trade-offs, but that's a topic for a different post.)

== Data Efficiency

The mobile app creates documents based on temperature readings that need to record a slew of related information.footnote:[See link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/connect-fall-2017-demo/blob/master/mobile/android/CBCHealth/app/src/main/java/com/couchbase/mobile/app/temperature/TemperatureActivity.java[TemperatureActivity.java]]
For the dashboard, we only need a small subset of that data.
We could retrieve the whole document with a key/value lookup.
That would be fast, but means transferring data we don't care about.
It's easy enough to use a {N1QL} query to pare down the data.
While N1QL is incredibly efficient, this still means processing through your query nodes.

With Functions, you get a copy of the document with each update.
Naturally you can extract the data you want from there quite easily.
Since Eventing is an link:https://www.couchbase.com/multi-dimensional-scalability-overview[independent service], you can scale the resources you dedicate to your Functions separately from the rest of your cluster.

== The Code

The actual code involved here is pretty straightforward.

=== Couchbase Functions

Here's the Functions part.
You set add this either through the Eventing panel of the Couchbase Server console, or via a REST call.footnote:[Find complete setup details link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-data-platform-action-setup-steps/[here]]

[source,javascript]
----
function OnUpdate(doc, meta) {
  if (doc.resourceType != 'Observation') return;
  
  let reference = doc.subject.reference;
  let url = "http://localhost:8080/events/" + reference.substr(9);
  let data = JSON.stringify({
    "reference": doc.subject.reference,
    "code": doc.code.coding[0].code,
    "recordedAt": doc.issued,
    "value": doc.valueQuantity.value
  });
    
  let curl = SELECT CURL($url, {
    "request": "POST",
    "header": [ "Content-Type: application/json", "accept: application/json" ],
    "data": $data
  });
  
  curl.execQuery();
}

function OnDelete(meta) {}
----

In the FHIR specification, documents all have a `resourceType`.
We only look at "Observation" resources, so the first check filters on that.

Next, we extract the UUID of the patient from the subject reference field.
That gets used in routing on the web app server side.  (See the next section for more on this.)

Then we create a JSON string with only the subject reference, a code indicating the type of observation made, the date this particular one was taken, and the measurement value.
That's the only data we need to pass.

Finally, we make use of the {cURL-}[cURL] capability in N1QL to POST that data to the app server REST endpoint.

=== Web Server REST Endpoint

The app server is written in link:https://nodejs.org[Node] using link:https://expressjs.com[Express].
We defined a link:https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html[route] in Express to create the endpoint used in the cURL call in the Functions code.

Here's the code.

[source,javascript]
----
router.post('/:id', function(req, res, next) {
  res.send('');

  if (sse[req.params.id] === undefined) return; // Not listening yet

  sse[req.params.id](`event: update\ndata: { "values": [${JSON.stringify(req.body)}]}\n\n`);
});

module.exports = router;
----

Express let's you define a portion of a route, and then hang it off of a longer path when wiring things together.
Hence all you see here is the end part of the route specification.
The `:id` element tells Express to take the last segment of the URL and feed it to our callback as a parameter.
Recall here we add the patient UUID as the last part of the URL path.
So that's what the `id` parameter gets set to.

Having triggered this route with our cURL call, we need to get the information pushed out to the web client.
We could have used web sockets.
Instead, we chose to use link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events[server-sent events].
SSEs are lighter weight than web sockets, and work well for this purpose.
We'll go into SSEs further in another post.
For now, just think of it as a message channel that uses a very simple format.

That gives us what we need to know to understand the callback code.
The first line specifies the route.
The second line sends an empty response, to close out the cURL session.
Next we check whether the server-sent events channel has been set up yet.
This happens via a call from the client.
If the SSE channel is ready, we tag our data as an "update" event, and send out the same JSON we received.

== Conclusion

Functions are probably my favorite new feature in Couchbase Server 5.5.
We looked at one example here, and you can see it doesn't take much to get started.
There are a lot of other uses cases to look at, too.
Deploying business logic right along side data, with easy scaling, all without adding infrastructure, that's pretty cool stuff.
