High Availabilty (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) are two of the driving reasons to move from a traditiontal RDBMS to a NoSQL-based
system like {CBS}.  In this link:https://event.on24.com/eventRegistration/EventLobbyServlet?target=reg20.jsp&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.couchbase.com%2Fresources%2Fwebinars&eventid=1569790&sessionid=1&key=86048A27BD53D35AFA6FFF8D43A09435&regTag=&sourcepage=register[webinar]
we went over the many features of Couchbase Server that address HA and DR.

In the webinar, we presented a demonstration of how to set up a multi-master, multi-region pair of clusters.  To
complement the webinar and other resources (see links at the end), we've created a step-by-step tutorial walking through everything needed
to create a multi-master, multi-region set of clusters, and replicate data between them.  You can find the tutorial link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/xdcr-java-sample/blob/master/Tutorial.adoc[here].

We also showed a sample application running that uses the Couchbase Multi-Cluster Aware (MCA) client.  The source code for the application is up on GitHub link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/xdcr-java-sample[here].
Look for another blog post explaining the code to come out shortly.

The MCA client is available with an enterprise subscription.  If you're interested in finding out more, please contact your Couchbase sales representative.

=== Other Resources

Replication between clusters relies on Couchbase's Cross-Data Center Replication (XDCR) feature.  Here are some more related links.
